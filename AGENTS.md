## Project Philosophy

- Fun, readable code first—this is a rapid prototype!
- Gameplay feel, juice, and accessibility are more important than "realistic" simulation.
- Clear variable names and helpful comments encouraged.
- Arcade style, vibrant colors, positive energy.

## Coding & Contribution Guidelines

- Use Raylib's 2D features for all rendering and input.
- New features: branch off main, submit as PR with clear description.
- Always keep the project compiling and runnable.
- Code should be easy to follow, even for non-expert C++ users.

## Current Focus / Next Steps

- Replace paddle rectangles with stickman or simple human sprites.
- Add visible rackets to player(s).
- Implement ball scaling for simulated height during "lob" or "smash" shots.
- Expand umpire calls/personality; add crowd reactions.

## Tone & Output

- Umpire should be slightly dramatic and amusing, and occasionaly mean-spirited or even darkly surreal.
- Game text in UK English.
- Visuals: bright, playful, arcade-inspired.

## Do Not Touch (without discussion)

- Do not add network or online features.
- No external physics engines.
- Avoid C++ features requiring C++20 or newer (unless agreed).

## Future Ideas

- Two-player local mode
- "Story" mode or challenge ladders
- Unlockable characters, courts, or power-ups
- More complex AI or "boss" opponents

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Compiles and runs
- [ ] Clear code and comments
- [ ] README updated if necessary
- [ ] Fun factor preserved!
